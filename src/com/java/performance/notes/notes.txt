Performance Testing Interview Questions with Detailed Examples:

1. What is Performance Testing and why is it needed?
👉 Definition:
Performance testing evaluates how a system behaves under different workloads (speed, stability, scalability).
👉 Example:
Imagine a bank’s mobile app. If 1,000 users try to transfer money at the same time, the app shouldn’t crash or slow down.
Performance testing ensures transactions are processed within acceptable limits.

2. Difference between Performance, Load, Stress, Spike, Endurance (Soak), and Scalability testing.

1. Performance Testing: General term for testing system speed & stability.

2. Load Testing: Test system with expected user load.
Ex: A ticket-booking site expected to handle 5,000 users at once. Test with 5,000 users.

3. Stress Testing: Push beyond limits until it breaks.
Ex: Push 20,000 users until server crashes → know the breaking point.

4. Spike Testing: Sudden increase in load.
Ex: Flipkart sale: users jump from 1k → 20k instantly.

5. Endurance (Soak) Testing: Long-duration test.
Ex: Run 1,000 users for 12 hours to check memory leaks.

6. Scalability Testing: Check if the system can scale up/down.
Ex: API runs fine on 4 servers. Add 2 more servers → performance should improve.

3. What are performance bottlenecks and how do you identify them?
👉 Definition:
Bottlenecks are weak points that slow performance.
👉 Examples:
High CPU usage → inefficient code.
High DB response time → unoptimized queries.
Low network bandwidth → too much data transfer.
👉 How to identify:
Use monitoring tools (Grafana, CloudWatch, New Relic) alongside test results.

4. What metrics do you typically monitor during performance testing?
Response Time (Avg, Min, Max, Percentiles).
Throughput (Requests/sec).
Error rate (% failures).
CPU/Memory/Disk I/O usage.
Network latency.

👉 Example:
During a JMeter test, API response time = 1.5s (90th percentile SLA ≤ 2s), throughput = 200 req/sec, CPU at 70%. Looks healthy.

5. Difference between client-side and server-side performance?
Client-side: Time spent rendering page/UI in browser.
Server-side: Time server takes to process requests.
👉 Example:
API takes 800ms (server-side).
Page takes 3s to load images, JS, CSS (client-side).
Both must be optimized separately.

🔹 Tool-based Questions
1. Which performance testing tools have you used?
👉 Example Answer:
I’ve used JMeter for API load testing. For distributed load, I’ve integrated it with BlazeMeter.
I’ve also used Locust (Python-based) for simulating millions of users.

2. How do you parameterize test data?
👉 Example in JMeter:
Use CSV Data Set Config to pass dynamic usernames & passwords instead of hardcoding.
👉 Example in Locust:

from locust import HttpUser, task
import random

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def login(self):
        user = random.choice(["user1", "user2", "user3"])
        self.client.post("/login", {"username": user, "password": "pass123"})

3. How do you simulate concurrent users?
👉 In JMeter, set Thread Group → Number of Threads = 1000.
👉 In Locust, run: locust -f load_test.py --users 1000 --spawn-rate 50
This simulates 1000 users ramping up at 50/sec.

4. How do you monitor server health during a test run?
👉 Example: Integrate JMeter with Grafana + Prometheus to track CPU, memory, GC, and DB latency.
👉 Cloud apps: Use AWS CloudWatch for EC2/RDS metrics.

5. How do you analyze JMeter results?
👉 Check Aggregate Report:
Avg response = 1.8s
90th percentile = 2.1s (if SLA is 2s → fail)
Throughput = 250 req/sec
👉 Graphs help identify slow endpoints.

🔹 Scenario-based Questions
1. Login API slows down at 1,000 users. How to debug?
Check DB (too many connections? slow queries?).
Check CPU/memory usage.
Check authentication service.
👉 Example: Found DB had only 200 max connections → increase pool size.

2. Response times increase gradually in a 2-hour test.
👉 Likely memory leak or resource exhaustion.
👉 Example: JVM heap memory keeps growing → OutOfMemoryError after 3 hours.

3. How do you determine workload model?
👉 Use production logs or business estimates.
👉 Example:
E-commerce site → 60% users browse products, 30% add to cart, 10% checkout. Model test accordingly.

4. If response time is high, how do you find root cause?
If DB queries are slow → DB issue.
If CPU is high → code inefficiency.
If network latency is high → bandwidth issue.
👉 Example: Payment API slow due to DB index missing on transaction_id.

5. How to design test for e-commerce checkout flow?
👉 Typical flow: Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order Confirmation.
👉 Distribute load: 60% browsing, 30% cart, 10% payment.

🔹 Metrics & Analysis
1. What is throughput vs response time?
Throughput: Requests/sec.
Response time: Time for 1 request.
👉 Example: API handles 300 req/sec with avg response 1.2s.

2. What is 90th percentile response time?
👉 90% of requests complete within this time.
👉 Example: 90th percentile = 2s means 90% requests finish ≤ 2s.

3. What is TPS and how to calculate?
👉 TPS = Total transactions / Total time.
👉 Example: 6000 logins in 60s → 100 TPS.

4. What is SLA in performance testing?
👉 SLA = agreed performance targets.
👉 Example: “Checkout API must respond ≤ 2s for 95% requests.”

5. What if SLA is not met?
👉 Analyze bottlenecks, tune DB/infra/code, retest.
👉 Example: SLA = 1s response, current = 2.5s. Found unoptimized SQL query → add index → response = 1.1s.

🔹 Real-time / Advanced

1. How do you test microservices/distributed systems?
👉 Focus on individual APIs + end-to-end flow.
👉 Use correlation IDs for tracing requests.
👉 Example: Payment service depends on Auth + Wallet + DB. If Wallet is slow, Payment slows.

2. How to test APIs vs web apps?
APIs → JSON/XML payloads, measure TPS, response.
Web apps → End-to-end flows with UI, also test rendering.

3. How do you integrate performance testing in CI/CD?
👉 Run JMeter/Locust in pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
👉 Fail build if SLA not met.
👉 Example: jmeter -n -t test.jmx -l results.jtl -e -o report runs automatically after deployment.

4. How do you estimate number of users to simulate?
👉 Formula: Peak load × Concurrency %
👉 Example: 100k daily users, peak concurrency = 10% → 10k users simulated.

5. Common DB bottlenecks in apps?
Missing indexes.
Too many joins.
Connection pool limit.

Large result sets.
👉 Example: Query SELECT * FROM orders slowed checkout → replaced with indexed query SELECT order_id, status FROM orders WHERE user_id=?.
